The initial data to feed the new CCTV release, came from the alpha stage of the project. 

The aim of this repository was to fill the gap between the end f the alpha stage and the beginning of the beta (and final) stage.

The alpha stage stopped producing data on the 2023-05-09, the same day that the beta stage started producing data. We had to combine the data from this two sources for this particular day.

The production of automatic daily files started on the 23rd May 2023, so I had to upload daily files for both models for the period between 2023-05-10 and 2023-05-22.

Furthermore, the A36 duplication problem (for every 30 min there were two A36 cams) finished on the 2023-05-11 at 12:34. Consequently, we removed the A36 camera until 2023-05-11 and copied this camera's data to a file for  later processing.
